# Team Builder CLI Application

## Description
The Team Builder CLI Application is a Node.js command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to build a team of workers and generate an HTML page displaying the team's information. The motivation behind creating this application is to provide a convenient way for managers to keep track of their team members' information in one place.
Through building this project, the developer has learned how to create a command-line interface application using Node.js, how to write modular and maintainable code, and how to work with external dependencies and libraries.
